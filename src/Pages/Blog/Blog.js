                </h1>
                <p className="text-xl  mt-1">
                    A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece
                    of code that can be logically isolated in a system. <br />
                    As a unit state gives a view wheater each portion of code is
                    properly working or not, thats why unit every devoloper
                    should run unit test.

                    Q-5:Why you do not set the state directly in React. For
                    example, if you have const [products, setProducts] =
                    useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead,
                    you use the setProducts

                    Q-5:How does prototypical inheritance work?
                </h1>
                <p className="text-xl  mt-1">
                    Prototypal Inheritance is that an object can point to
                    another object and inherit all its properties. The main
                    purpose is to allow multiple instances of an object to share
                    common properties, hence, the Singleton Pattern.
